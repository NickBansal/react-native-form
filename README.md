# React Native App

This is a simple form created in react-native-app that will link up to the backend. it consists of a sign up form which will then send data to the backend and store a new User.

This project was created on React-native for mobile phone useage. The project was created using the following commands in the terminal:

```js
$ expo init User-Login
```


In order to create the project I installed native-base:

```js
$ npm install native-base
```
